## Description

This app is a simple note-taking app that uses express.js as the server base for the app. This allows you to access the required information across any devices you may have. When you go to the site you will be introduced to the app's main page:

![notifyme main page](/assets/images/main-page.png)

 when you press the button you will be led to a notes page:

![notes-page view](/assets/images/notes-page.png)

Here you can put in a note title and text for the note and a Save Icon will appear:

![save icon](/assets/images/save-icon.png)

After you press the save icon the note will be saved and the title will appear in a list to the side

![note list](/assets/images/note-list.png)

If you press on the title in this list the note context will appear in the center field:

![view note on title click](/assets/images/view-note.png)

You can delete any notes by pressing on the red delete button to the side of the note title:

![delete button](/assets/images/delete-btn.png)

![updated list view](/assets/images/updated-list.png)

If you press the "+" button in the top corner it will exit out of the note view and allow you to enter in a new note
